# Assets needed

- Light Modifiers
    - Brolly

If you add new assets, please remember to add them to combined.svg so that users can grab just that file if they want all of the shapes at once (without having to download the .zip or clone the entire repo).

## Format
For maximum compatibility and scalability create the components as scalable vector graphics (SVG) in [Inkscape][]. This will let all users scale them as needed for their output.

[Inkscape]: https://inskscape.org

Please put each unique asset in its own svg file.  This should facilitate drag-and-drop into Inkscape for inclusion quickly and easily.
