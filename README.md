# Lighting-Diagram
Assets to generate lighting diagrams and setups.

There are no Free/Libre resources for creating photographic lighting diagrams available.  This repo is an attempt to rectify that.  All of the assets hosted here are available under a [Creative Commons, Attribution-ShareAlike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license.

This was prompted by community member Eric Mesa.

## Assets

### Download
If you just want to grab the shapes to build your own lighting diagrams, you can just grab the [combined.svg][] file (Right-click, Save link as...).  It _should_ contain all of the assets.
