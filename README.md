# Lighting-Diagram
Assets to generate lighting diagrams and setups.

This repo is created for all of us to have some svg assets to create lighting diagrams with.  This was prompted by community member Eric Mesa.

## Assets

I think a list of useful assets would be helpful for those wanting to contribute something.  A first take:

* Cameras
    * DSLR
    * Mirrorless
    * MF
* Strobes
    * Speedlight
    * Monoblock
* Lighting Modifiers
    * Softbox (+ grid?)
    * Umbrella (+ grid?)
    * Octabox (+ grid?)
    * Brolly
* Reflectors
* Flags
* Barn Doors / Gobo
* Light stands? (C-Stands?)
* Environmental
    * Chairs
    * Stools
    * Boxes
    * Backgrounds (+ stands)
* Models
