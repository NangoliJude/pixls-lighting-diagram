# Lighting-Diagram
Assets to generate lighting diagrams and setups.

There are no Free/Libre resources for creating photographic lighting diagrams available.  This repo is an attempt to rectify that.  All of the assets hosted here are available under a [Creative Commons, Attribution-ShareAlike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license.

This was prompted by community member Eric Mesa.

## Assets

I think a list of useful assets would be helpful for those wanting to contribute something.  A first take:

* Cameras
    * DSLR
    * Mirrorless
    * MF
* Strobes
    * Speedlight
    * Monoblock
* Lighting Modifiers
    * Softbox (+ grid?)
    * Umbrella (+ grid?)
    * Octabox (+ grid?)
    * Brolly
* Reflectors
* Flags
* Barn Doors / Gobo
* Light stands? (C-Stands?)
* Environmental
    * Chairs
    * Stools
    * Boxes
    * Backgrounds (+ stands)
* Models


## Format
For maximum compatibility and scalability create the components as scalable vector graphics (SVG) in [Inkscape][]. This will let all users scale them as needed for their output.

[Inkscape]: https://inskscape.org

Possibly put each unique asset in it's own svg file right now?  This should facilitate drag-and-drop into Inkscape for inclusion quickly and easily.
