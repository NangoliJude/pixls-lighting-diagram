# Lighting-Diagram
Assets to generate lighting diagrams and setups like this one:

![example lighting setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/djotaku/pixls-lighting-diagram/master/examples/portrait_lighting_setup.png)

They can be used to plan a photoshoot ahead of time or to communicate your setup to other photographers. Here is an example of a professional photographer, Gavin Hooey, using lighting diagrams to show viewers how his lights are setup: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUCQQ8Cp9h4 . 

## Assets Downloading

If you just want to grab the shapes to build your own lighting diagrams, you can just grab the [combined.svg][] file (Right-click, Save link as...).  It _should_ contain all of the assets.
